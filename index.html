<h2>Write-Up</h2>
    <p> We chose a scatterplot to represent greenhouse gas emissions over time because scatterplots are effective at showing discrete data and its changes. This allows people to visualize emissions data every year. The scatter plot also works better for smaller countries where the emissions vary significantly. A lot of data is also missing so the scatter plot emphasizes the discreteness of the data.


Drop-down selection: Allows users to visualize emissions trends for different countries. Users can select a specific country, focusing the display on that country's emissions data.

Zoom: Allows users to zoom in and out, providing a closer look at specific time periods or ranges of emissions data. 

Tooltip: Tooltips appear when users hover over data points. It provides more detailed information about the emissions value and the corresponding year. This makes it easier to see the data.

While designing the visualization, we considered alternative approaches, such as using a line chart instead of a scatterplot and a slider instead of a drop-down menu. However, we chose the scatter plot to emphasize individual data points and make it easier to see each year's values. The dropdown for country selection was also better as it provides an easier way to select  countries compared to a slider.

In terms of design considerations, we wanted to make the data as easy to visualize as possible. We decided to create Axis limits on the years and the data so that the data's changes would be seen easily. We also made the colors more appealing so that it would be easier to look at.</p>

    We first worked together to clean up the data file from the source and saved it as data.csv. After we then split up the work as one person worked on implementing the data visualization components from D3.js, while the other team member worked on the dropdown menus, zoom functionality, and other features. Then we split up the work between creating the index.html file and the CSS file for style. Deploying the website was done as a team. We spent roughly around 6 to 7 in people-hours developing the files and program. The part that we spent the most time on was probably implementing the zoom feature on the website. This is because we had run into an issue where zooming into the data caused it not to show clearly on the website. Another part of the project that took some more time was implementing the dropdown menu as we had some difficulty figuring it out.
